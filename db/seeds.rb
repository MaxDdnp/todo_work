# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
# #   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
 # proj = Project.create!(name: 'First')
 # Task.create(name: 'grocery shopping', status: 'undone', project_id: proj.id, deadline: "2013-08-14")
